# Scope of a variable

## The scope of a variable refers to the visibility of a variable, or , which parts of a program can access that variable

## It all depends on where this variable is being declared

## If it is declared inside any curly braces {}, i.e., a block of code, its scope is restricted within the braces, otherwise the scope is global.
