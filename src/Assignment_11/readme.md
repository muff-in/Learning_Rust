# Arrays

## An array is a homogenous sequence of elements

## Being a compound type, it is used when the collection of values of the same type are to be stored in a single variable

## In Rust, an array can only be of a fixed length

## Like all other languages, each element in the array is assigned an index. By default, the first element is always at index 0
