// Floating Point Numbers

// Floating-point numbers refer to numbers with a fractional part.

// The representation of floating-point numbers in a computerâ€™s memory is such that the precision with which a number is stored in memory depends on the number of bits used for storing the variable.

// f means floating-point and 32 means 32-bit and 64 means 64-bit

// explicitly define a float type

fn main() {
    let f1: f32 = 32.9; // The 32-bit floating-point type
    let f2: f64 = 6789.89; // The 64-bit floating-point type
    println!("f1: {}", f1);
    println!("f2: {}", f2);
}

// output: f1: 32.9, f2: 6789.89
