// variables

// A variable is like a storage box paired with an associated name which contains data. 
// The associated name is the identifier and the data that goes inside the variable is the value. 
// They are immutable by default, meaning, you cannot reassign value to them.

// Create a variable

  // let keyword is used to create a variable

    let x; // let is the identifier and x is the variable name after that we use semicolon to end the statement

// you would write a variable name in a snake_case.
