// Initialize a variable

// to initialize a variable, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to the variable.

// Itâ€™s possible to declare the variable first and assign it a value later. 
// However, it is not recommended to do this as it may lead to the use of uninitialized variables.


fn main() { 
    let language = "Rust"; // we declares a variable, language , and initializes it with a value, Rust.
    println!("Language: {}", language); // Just like numbers it is not possible to directly print a variable within a println!(). You need a placeholder.
}

// output: Language: Rust
