There are many differences between const and let variables.

* Declaration
- Constant variables are declared using the const keyword unlike let variables.

* Scope
- const variables are declared in global and local scope unlike let variables that are declared only in the local scope.

* Mutability
- const variable cannot be mutable unlike let which can be made mutable using mut keyword.

* Data Type
- Unlike let variables, it is mandatory to define the data type of const variables.

* Set Value at Run-time
- The value of const variable can only be set before running the program whereas the let variable can store the result at runtime.

* Shadowing
- Unlike let variables, const variables cannot be shadowed.
