// Data Type
// Rust is a statically typed language, meaning, it must know the type of all variables at compile time.

// We can define a variable in rust in two different ways:

// Implicit Definition
// Unlike C++ or jave, Rust can infer the type from the type of value assigned to a variable.

fn main() {
    let implicit_variable = "Implicitly typed variable"; // this is how we define implicitly typed variables
    println!("{}", implicit_variable);
}
